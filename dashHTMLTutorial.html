<h1> Zhanxi Ni </h1>

<p> Hi! I'm Zhanxi Ni, a SF-based software engineering student </p>

<!--
  According to the HTML style guide from W3Schools:
  -it is best to keep everything (tags, code) lowercase
  -not mix upper and lower case letters
  -lowercase looks cleaner and is easier to write

  In addition, have:
  -few spaces
  -add quotes to attribute's values
  -indent and space as only logically necessary
-->

<!--
  Here, we have "type" as the attribute
  And "email" as the attribute value
  Attributes and their values are options for each tag object
-->

<!--
  Use a "placeholder" attribute to describe default text next to input
-->

<input type="email" placeholder="Your email">


<input type="submit">
